# CPTR 142: Project III Specifications

The specifications outlines the project design specifications and project management.
This is done BEFORE CODING!

Here are the things to include in this codument.

* ___Complete UML diagrams___ of classes, member variables, member functions, and relationships between classes.
  What structures and menus will be required?  
* ___Procedural Flow Diagram___ The logical flow of your program
* ___Anticipated challenges___ and how will you address them?  

_______________________________________________________________________
Anticipated challanges include clear communication as we have very different schedules and one
of us also lives off campus, thus our main form of communication is texting. The generating and
solving algorithms are anticipated to be difficult as they will require a substancial amount
of trial and error testing to see what works.
___________________________________________________________________________


* ___Project Management Plan___
  * Name __individual group member tasks/responsibilities__.
    Split up the tasks and implementation into portions per group member.
  * __Timeline__ of individual and group delivery dates.
